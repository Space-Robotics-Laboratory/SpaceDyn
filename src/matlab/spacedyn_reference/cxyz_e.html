<b>Direction Cosine Matrix in SpaceDyn</b><br>
Suppose that R is a vector subject to rotation around x-axis of an inertial reference frame by roll [rad], and the resulting vector is S.<br>
If another vector X is expressed as <font size="2">I</font>X in the inertial frame,<br>
There is a following relationship among R, S, and a direction cosine C.<br>
<font size="2">I</font>S = Cx( roll ) * <font size="2">I</font>R<br>
<br>

R is rotated around x-axis of the inertial reference frame by roll [rad],<br>
followed by another rotation around y-axis of the rotated reference frame by pitch [rad],<br>
followed by another rotation around z-axis of the rotated reference frame by yaw [rad],<br>
Let the resulting vector be T.<br>
The direction cosine of this rotation is expressed as follows.<br>
C = Cz( yaw ) * Cy( pitch ) * Cx( roll )<br>
Hence,<br>
<font size="2">I</font>T = C * <font size="2">I</font>R<br>
<br>

Therefore, direction cosine matrices are capable of rotating vectors in the same reference frame.<br>
