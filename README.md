# SpaceDyn
The Spacedyn is a MATLAB Toolbox for the kinematic and dynamic analysis and simulation of articulated multi-body systems with a moving base. Examples of such systems are a satellite with mechanical appendages, a free-flying space robot, a wheeled mobile robot, and a walking robot, all of which makes motions in the environment with or without gravity.
